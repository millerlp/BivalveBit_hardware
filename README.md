# BivalveBit hardware
 Heart rate and valve gape sensor wearable for oysters and mussels. 
 This hardware is described in the publication "Monitoring bivalve behavior and physiology in the laboratory and field using open-source tools" L.P. Miller (2022) *Integrative and Comparative Biology*
 
 [https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac046](https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac046)
 
 * Based around a ATmega4808 microcontroller
 * Designed to fit inside a nominal 3/4" schedule 40 PVC plumbing pipe (<18.5mm
 inside diameter) along with an 18650 size Lithium-Ion battery cell. 
 * Provides one I2C 4-pin port for communicating with a IR heart rate sensor
 * Provides one analog 4-pin port for communicating with an analog sensor such
 as the A1395 Hall effect sensor (with SLEEP pin on the 4th wire). 
 * Writes data to a standard microSD card
